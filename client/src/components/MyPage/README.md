# MyPage - Movie Recommendations

This page allows users to explore movie recommendations based on their preferences and interactions with the app. The following features are supported:

1. Movie Title Search:
   - The user can search for a movie by its title.
   - Upon searching, the system will display information about the movie, such as its director, lead actors, release year, and genre.

2. Movie Recommendations:
   - After viewing a movie's details, the user can request movie recommendations based on that movie.
   - The system will recommend other movies that share the same lead actor(s) as the selected movie.
   - The user can browse through the recommended movies to find new options to watch.

3. User Feedback:
   - The user has the option to mark whether they liked or disliked the recommended movies.
   - The system will take this feedback into account to further refine future recommendations.

4. Movie Trailers:
   - For recommended movies, the user can view embedded trailers (if available) to get a glimpse of the movie's content.

Please note:
- The app will use client-side routing for a seamless user experience when navigating between different sections of the MyPage.
- The movie recommendations are based on a combination of user interactions, lead actors, and movie genres to provide personalized suggestions.
- The app will save the user's feedback to avoid recommending movies that the user didn't enjoy in the future.

Implementation:
- The MyPage component will be built using React and will interact with the backend server to retrieve movie details and recommendations.
- The UI will follow Material-UI styling guidelines for a visually consistent experience across the app.

For testing purposes, we will include a limited set of movie data in the database to demonstrate the functionality. The app can be further enhanced by adding more data and refining the recommendation algorithm.

This README provides an overview of the MyPage functionality. As development progresses, more details will be added, including technical specifications, API endpoints, and database schema.
